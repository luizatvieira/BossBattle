# Boss Battle
This is a little boss battle demo I'm currently experimenting with! I hope to be able to upload it on game jolt one day ^^

## Objectives
I started this project so I could experiment and play with a few different concepts and unity tools, such as:
- Unity's Input System;
- Enemy AI;
- Shaders and particle systems;
- Cinemachine.

By the end of the project I expect to have created a full boss battle demo, in which:
- The player will have to kill the boss in order to win, if the player's HP hit zero before that, he will loose;
- The player will have two different attacks (one meelee and one ranged) and a dash;
- The boss will have a few attack sequences and will pick and choose which it will use, according to its remaining health;
- There will be cool visual effects for each attack.

## Currently Complete
As of right now, what is currently complete is:
- Player movement almost complete!(only visuals are missing);
- Player auto target shooting;
- Cinemachine camera switch
